OT92: Ocean Thread
This is the bi-weekly visible open thread (there are also hidden open threads twice a week you can reach through the Open Thread tab on the top of the page). Post about anything you want, ask random questions, whatever. You can also talk at the SSC subreddit or the SSC Discord server. Also: 1. This is your last chance to take the 2017-2018 Slate Star Codex reader survey. I will be closing it tomorrow. 2. New ad on the sidebar: Shearwater, a Boston tech startup that helps universities run mentorship programs, is looking for software engineers. 3. Happy new year! Share this: Twitter Facebook
