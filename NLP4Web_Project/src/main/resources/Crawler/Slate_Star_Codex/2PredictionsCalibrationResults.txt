2017 Predictions: Calibration Results
At the beginning of every year, I make predictions. At the end of every year, I score them. Here are 2014, 2015, and 2016. And here are the predictions I made for 2017. Strikethrough’d are false. Intact are true. Italicized are getting thrown out because I can’t decide if they’re true or not. WORLD EVENTS 1.

I weight < 195 pounds at the end of 2017: 70% Some justifications for my decisions: I rated the civil war in Syria as basically over, even though Wikipedia says otherwise, since I don’t think there are any remaining credible rebel forces, and ISIS is pretty dead. Trump’s approval rating is taken from this 538 aggregator and is currently estimated at 38.1%. I rated the border wall as not currently under construction, despite articles with titles like The Trump Administration Has Already Started Building The Border Wall, because it was referring to a 30-foot prototype not likely to be included in the wall itself (have I mentioned the media is terrible?). I refused to judge the success of the Less Wrong renaissance attempt, because it seemed unsuccessful but was superseded by a separate much more serious attempt that was successful and I’m not sure how to rate that. I refused to judge whether or not I got a new partner because I am casually dating some people and not sure how to count it. I refused to judge whether I got 95th percentile+ on my PRITE because they stopped clearly reporting percentile scores. This is the graph of my accuracy for this year: Of 50% predictions, I got 5 right and 3 wrong, for a score of 62% Of 60% predictions, I got 14 right and 8 wrong, for a score of 64% Of 70% predictions, I got 8 right and 5 wrong, for a score of 62% Of 80% predictions, I got 16 right and 2 wrong, for a score of 89% Of 90% predictions, I got 24 right and 1 wrong, for a score of 96% Of 95% predictions, I got 8 right and 1 wrong, for a score of 89% Of 99% predictions, I got 4 right and 0 wrong, for a score of 100% Blue is hypothetical perfect calibration, red is my calibration. The multiple crossings of the blue line indicate that I am neither globally overconfident or globally underconfident. Last year my main concern was that I was underconfident at 70%. I tried to fix that this year by becoming more willing to guess at that level, and ended up a bit overconfident. This year I’ll try somewhere in the middle and hopefully get it right. There weren’t enough questions to detect patterns of mistakes, but there was a slight tendency for me to think things would go more smoothly than they did. I overestimated the success of my diet, my savings plan, my travel plans my job start date, my long-FAQ-making ability, and my future housing search (this last one led to me spending a few weeks at a friend’s group house, failing on a 95% certainty prediction). I only made one error in favor of personal affairs going better than expected (SSC got more hits than last year; maybe this isn’t a central example of “personal affairs going smoothly”). None of these really caused me any problems, suggesting that I have enough slack in my plans, but apparently I’m not yet able to extend that to being able to make good explicit predictions about. My other major error was underestimating the state of the US economy, leading to a couple of correlated errors. I think I got Trump mostly right, although I may have overestimated his efficacy (I thought he would have started the border wall by now) and erred in thinking he would lift sanctions on Russia. Otherwise this is consistent with generally good calibration plus random noise. Next year I’ll have played this game five years in a row, and I’ll average out all my answers for all five years and get a better estimate; for now I’ll just be pretty satisfied. Predictions for 2018 coming soon. Share this: Twitter Facebook
