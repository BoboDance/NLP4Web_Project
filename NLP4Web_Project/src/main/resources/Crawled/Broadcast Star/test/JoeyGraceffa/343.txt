He was my only guy friend I had growing up who didn't judge me for being more feminine, He taught me how to play video games and got me into anime. I wish I got to thank him for being my friend and teaching me so much.","id_str":"943665716984627200","in_reply_to_user_id":null,"display_text_range":[0,274],"favorite_count":44105,"id":943665716984627200,"place":null,"contributors":null,"lang":"en","user":{"id_str":"16794568","id":16794568},"favorited":false}
